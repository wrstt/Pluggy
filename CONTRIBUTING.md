Thanks for contributing.

This repository accepts pull requests, but the project is source-available (not open source) and has license restrictions (including non-commercial use and no modified redistribution without permission except for PR/patch submissions). Read `LICENSE` before contributing.

## Ground Rules

- Keep changes scoped and reviewable.
- Avoid committing local data, logs, build artifacts, or credentials.
- Prefer repo-relative paths in docs/scripts (no machine-specific absolute paths).
- Preserve the default safety posture (torrent indexers off by default).

## Development Setup

See `README.md` for quick start.

## Pull Requests

Please include:

- what changed
- why it changed
- any user-facing behavior changes
- test/verification notes

## Contribution Licensing

- No separate CLA or DCO is required for normal PRs.
- By submitting a contribution, you agree it can be used under the terms described in `LICENSE`.

## Commit Hygiene

- One topic per commit when possible
- Clear commit messages
- No generated artifacts unless intentionally releasing

## Security / Privacy

- Do not submit personal auth files, local DBs, or logs
- Redact tokens, cookies, API keys, and usernames from screenshots/logs
- Report vulnerabilities privately (see `SECURITY.md`)
