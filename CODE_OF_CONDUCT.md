# Code of Conduct

Keep it simple:

- Be respectful.
- Keep discussion technical and productive.
- No harassment, hate, threats, doxxing, or spam.
- No personal attacks.

If someone is being a problem, maintainers can remove comments/issues/PRs or block access.

If needed, contact the maintainer privately on GitHub (`SSUNOs`).
