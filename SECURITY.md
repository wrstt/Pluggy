# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not post security vulnerabilities or privacy-sensitive issues in public GitHub issues.

Instead:

1. Contact the maintainer privately via GitHub (`SSUNOs`).
2. Include clear reproduction steps, affected files/components, and impact.
3. If possible, include a minimal proof of concept and suggested mitigation.

## What to Include

- Pluggy version / commit hash
- Operating system and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Logs or screenshots with secrets/tokens redacted

## Response Expectations

This is an independently maintained project, so response times may vary. Reasonable reports will be reviewed and triaged as time allows.

## Scope Notes

Please report:

- code execution issues
- privilege or sandbox escape issues
- auth/session issues
- data leakage/privacy issues
- unsafe default behavior that could expose user data
